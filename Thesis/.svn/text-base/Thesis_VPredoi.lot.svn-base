\contentsline {table}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Observational capabilities of some of the radio telescopes proposed for a joint GW-radio search effort. The aperture synthesis arrays like LOFAR and ETA have wide fields of view operating in relatively narrow frequency bands whereas the single dish telescopes like NRAO Green Bank and ARECIBO have significantly decreased fields of view but can operate within much broader frequency bands. Radio flux sensitivity is given in Jansky (1 Jy=$10^{-19}\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {erg}\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {m^{-2}\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {s^{-1}}\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm {Hz}}$). The slew time is how fast the telescope can turn around its symmetry axis to track a sky location.}}{56}

Results suggest a typical increase of $\approx $20\% in sensitivity from a search on 1 week of data all--sky to 2000s triggered; knowing the sky location of the GRB accounts for an increase of 6.4\% whereas knowing the exact time and being able to perform a search on a short stretch of data increases the sensitivity by 12.8\% (1 week $\rightarrow $ 2000s).}}{121}

\contentsline {table}{\numberline {5.1}{\ignorespaces False alarm rates and their errors for different combinations of trigger rates for a simple two--detector analysis in the cases of ``zero--lag'' (no timeslides, S=0) and S=100 timeslides. Trigger rates $R_1$ and $R_2$ are used in equations (5.25\hbox {}) and (5.26\hbox {}) to calculate the FAR and its error, $\sigma $; also in equation (5.28\hbox {}) to estimate the ceiling number of timeslides, $S_{\mathrm {c}}$. This illustrates the gain in confidence from a low--and--equal--trigger rates case. The very low trigger rates cases imply that the false alarm rate can be quoted only as a confidence interval [$-\sigma ,\sigma $] that approaches [$-10^{-6}, 10^{-6}$] for trigger rates in the mHz region. We repeat the last row in the second section of the table; this is motivated by a choice of very low single detector trigger rates allowing the performance of a considerable amount of timesliding ($S=10^3$, permitted by equation (5.28\hbox {})), in the case of an analyzed stretch of 2000 s, that, in turn, combined with very low and roughly equal single detector trigger rates (mHz), contribute to significantly lowering the $\sigma $ value of the FAR to reach $\approx 10^{-9}$ Hz and its error $\approx 10^{-7}$ Hz.}}{136}
