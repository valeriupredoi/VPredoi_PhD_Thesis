Trigger rates $R_1$ and $R_2$ are used in equations (5.25\hbox {}) and (5.26\hbox {}) to calculate the FAR and its error, $\sigma $; also in equation (5.28\hbox {}) to estimate the ceiling number of timeslides, $S_{\mathrm  {c}}$. This illustrates the gain in confidence from a low--and--equal--trigger rates case. The very low trigger rates cases imply that the false alarm rate can be quoted only as a confidence interval [$-\sigma ,\sigma $] that approaches [$-10^{-6}, 10^{-6}$] for trigger rates in the mHz region. We repeat the last row in the second section of the table; this is motivated by a choice of very low single detector trigger rates allowing the performance of a considerable amount of timesliding ($S=10^3$, permitted by equation (5.28\hbox {})), in the case of an analyzed stretch of 2000 s, that, in turn, combined with very low and roughly equal single detector trigger rates (mHz), contribute to significantly lowering the $\sigma $ value of the FAR to reach $\approx 10^{-9}$ Hz and its error $\approx 10^{-7}$ Hz.}}{136}}

The dashed contours representing the $\sigma $ of the FAR, for constant number of timeslides, reveal two very important findings: the error saturates and does not decrease anymore even if we would perform an infinite number of timeslides (this was also mentioned in equation (5.27\hbox {}), explaining the existence of a ceiling number of timeslides, above which there is no decrease in error); and justifies the performance of timeslides in order obtain a reduced error on the false alarm rate: the error decreases with increasing $S$.}}{139}}

Fitted (the dots) is the theoretical (expected) Poisson distribution of the number of occurrences, given by equation (5.39\hbox {}). The theoretical Poisson fit overestimates the number of triggers with low occurrence and underestimates the number of triggers with higher occurrence. This can be explained by correlations in trigger times due to non--Gaussian ``glitches''. We do not, however, notice a significant deviation from the predicted distribution; the expected occurrence for a fixed single detector trigger rate of 50 Hz, coincidence window width of $10^{-3}$ and 160 timeslides is $z=8$; the histogram peaks at roughly 5 occurrences.}}{141}}

The first slide is built by timeshifting by a certain amount (usually multiples of 6--s, exactly 6--s in this figure, or the length of a trial) the whole ``zero--lag'' and re--attaching the remainder to the other end of the data stretch (Trial 1 here); the second slide is built in the same manner with reattaching the remainder (here it would be Trial 2) and so on. After $S$ timeshifts we will have a 2--dimensional (in trial along one dimension and slide number along the other) mask populated with valid and vetoed trials.
