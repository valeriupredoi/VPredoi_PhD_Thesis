Image reproduced from \cite  {heasarc}. Together with the short durations, light curves represent strong proofs of the short hard nature of the GRBs in the sample. (Right figure) Light curve for GRB060103 (120--400 keV band), displaying a somewhat flat top structure. The width is roughly 2 s wide and the peak is steep, good indicators for a short burst.

This ensures an even search for signals.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7.3}{\ignorespaces  A typical IPN GRB error box populated with simulation points: the simulation points are firstly distributed along the central line of the IPN annulus, at 0.2 degrees relative distance; a square 2--D grid with a 0.2$\times $0.2 degrees cell is built across the error box. Then simulation points are randomly thrown in each bin centered at each point and sides equal to 0.2 degrees. The distribution of these points follows a 1-- or 2--dimensional Gaussian, depending on the number of IPN annuli: the width of the distribution corresponds to the width of the IPN annulus so that there are proportionally more simulation points thrown towards the center line of the annulus where the signal is expected to be found. In the case of two annuli, the 2--D Gaussian has the widths of the two IPN annuli. Here we see the distribution of simulation points for two intersecting IPN annuli, for GRB060522C, a short hard burst: there are more points towards the center of the intersection region and less towards the outer edge; the narrow IPN annulus intersecting the wider one will allow for an assymetric 2--D Gaussian distribution of simulation points, with more throws inside the narrow annulus and less inside the wider one.}}{171}}
